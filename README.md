# coolpool
CoolPool is an interactive singleplayer and multiplayer billiard game with realistic physics behaviour such as inelastic collisions and friction.
This game was designed for users who didn't have the iPhone version of pool but still wanted to play on their computers.

The signelplayer version features a single hole in the middle of the screen, for players to train their skills alone.
The multiplayer version is for two players to take turns shooting and is based on the number of stripes/solids + black ball scored.

Below are a few pictures of the game.
